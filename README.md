Flex sensor Arduino
A flex sensor uses carbon on a strip of plastic to act like a variable resistor. The resistance changes by flexing the component. The sensor bends in one direction, the more it bends, the higher the resistance gets. In this example we will use a flex sensor to fade an led. Ardumotive
